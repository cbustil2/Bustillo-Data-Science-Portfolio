# Spotify Data App 🎵

## Data Science Assignment 🎒
As part of an assignment, we are asked to make a basic streamlit app using data of our interests. Since I am very interested in music and have been using spotify for a while, I chose to take data from Maharshi Pandya from their Kaggle [Spoitfy Tracks Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset). As part of the assignment, we are asked to write at least 100 lines of code interacts with at least four columns of data (mix of numerical and categorical variables). Moreover, this app that we make is suppose to help us explore as well and filter out data, reaching unique insights.
