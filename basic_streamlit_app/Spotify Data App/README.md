  Spotify Data App 🎵

## Data Science Assignment 🎒
As part of an assignment, we are asked to make a basic streamlit app using data of our interests. Since I am very interested in music and have been using spotify for a while, I chose to take data from Maharshi Pandya from their Kaggle [Spoitfy Tracks Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset). As part of the assignment, we are asked to write at least 100 lines of code interacts with at least four columns of data (mix of numerical and categorical variables). Moreover, this app that we make is suppose to help us explore as well and filter out data, reaching unique insights. 

### Objectives and Goals:
- I hoped to make an app that focuses on energy level, danceability, popularity, and explicit/clean content to determine a list of songs.
- I acknowledge that its a bit difficult through just vibes by scaling, so I provided a histogram that focuses on the genre chosen to provide where a general range of the frequency of the songs based on energy level, danceability, and popularity.
- If that wasn't enough, I provided a way to foccus entirely on genre, popularity, and artists to narrow down the scope in another way.
- At the end, there is a way to choose the particular song from the given data frame and a button to load a link to the spotify song.
